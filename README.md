# graphql-morning-bytes

- For a basic example using the `graphql-js` reference implementation, see the `/client` and `/server` directories.
- For an example that uses Apollo Server & Apollo Client, see the `/with-apollo-client` and `/with-apollo-server` directories
- Each directory contains it's own `README.md` with instructions on how to start the GraphQL server. Client side code was bootstraped using `create-react-app`.
